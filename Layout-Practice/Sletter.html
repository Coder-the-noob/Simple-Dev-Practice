    <h2>Style the first letter of a paragraph and let it float left</h2>

    <p>
        <span>H</span>ere, the first letter of the paragraph is styled with CSS. The first letter will be displayed as a drop cap, and it will float to the left of the paragraph. The drop cap is styled with a background color, a border, and some padding. The text-indent property is used to make the first line of the paragraph start after the drop cap.
